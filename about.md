One of my most popular projects is the [Moodle questionnaire plugin](https://github.com/PoetOS/moodle-mod_questionnaire). Available in the Moodle Plugins Database, questionnaire is used on tens of thousands of sites and has been in the top twenty, and often the top ten most popular downloads since it was first released for Moodle 1.* many years ago.
I have other plugins in various states of development, that are gaining popularity as well.
Currently, these are maintained on my own time, or when specific work is sponsored. Your [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/mchurchward) would allow me to apply more efforts on these projects on a more regular schedule, and add new features as requested in a timely fashion.

### More Information

Questionnaire needs some love. This popular Moodle plugin has been in use since the early days of Moodle; close to 20 years. As such, it has collected a lot of technical debt. In order to continue to maintain this plugin effectively, it requires a refactoring of the code. This refactoring will:
* bring it up to current Moodle coding standards,
* separate function into maintainable classes,
* significantly reduce the amount of code,
* improve performance,
* set the path for future maintainability.
In order to achieve this, I need to dedicate time and resources. Your [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/mchurchward) can help that happen.
