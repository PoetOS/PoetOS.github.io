title: Questionnaire 3.7.0 released
---

This release provides the first release of the Moodle Mobile questionnaire app. The mobile app provides
all completion functions of the web based app, and allows individual review of completed questionnaires.
It does not include the feedback reporting options.

While every effort has been taken to ensure correct operation on mobile devices, this is the first release.
If problems are discovered, please report them at the Github repository 
(https://github.com/PoetOS/moodle-mod_questionnaire) or in the Moodle tracker (https://tracker.moodle.org/).

You can find the release on [Github](https://github.com/PoetOS/moodle-mod_questionnaire/tree/3.7.0) or in the [Moodle
plugins database](https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversion.php?id=20438).

This marks the end of a successful campaign. Thanks to all the contributors!
