title: New Questionnaire release for Moodle 3.4
---

A new release of questionnaire for the 3.4 branch is now available at the 
[Moodle plugins database](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_questionnaire).

This release includes two new features, provided with help from C. Jobst
and Y. Annanias of the University of Leipzig and the Online-Self-Assessment
project for the Faculty of Economics and Management Science, funded by the
EU/ESF (The European Social Fund in Germany).

These feature are:
1. Multiple parent questions. Questions can now be dependent on multiple
question responses.
2. Multiple feedback scoring. Questions can now be assigned to more than one
feedback section for personality test scoring.

Details can be found in the [release notes]
(https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversion.php?id=15624).
