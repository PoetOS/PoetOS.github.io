title: New Questionnaire release 3.5.1
---

Release 3.5.1 of questionnaire for the 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 branches is now available at the 
[Moodle plugins database](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_questionnaire).

This release includes a complete overhaul of the feedback options UI. The feedback UI is
now accessed from the module settings menu and tabs. Each section can now be easily
accessed and managed on one page. Questions are now assigned to sections rather than
sections assigned to questions.

Thanks to C. Jobst & Y. Annanias of the University of Leipzig and the Online-Self-Assessment
project for the Faculty of Economics and Management Science, funded by the EU/ESF
(The European Social Fund in Germany) for the resources and efforts for these features.

Many more features and improvements are included.
Details can be found in the [release notes](https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversion.php?id=18146).
