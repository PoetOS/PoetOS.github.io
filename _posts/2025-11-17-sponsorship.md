Questionnaire needs some love. This popular Moodle plugin has been in use since the early days of Moodle; close to 20 years. As such, it has collected a lot of technical debt. In order to continue to maintain this plugin effectively, it requires a refactoring of the code. This refactoring will:

* bring it up to current Moodle coding standards,
* separate function into maintainable classes,
* significantly reduce the amount of code,
* improve performance,
* set the path for future maintainability.

In order to achieve this, I need to dedicate time and resources. Your [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/mchurchward) can help that happen.
